# VBA-Challenge
I created a VBA script that loops through each year of stock data and outputs the ticker symbol, the yearly change from opening price to closing price at the end of that year, the percent change from opening price to closing price at the end of that year, and the total stock volume of the stock. The positive yearly change is highlighted in green, and the negative yearly change is highlighted in red.
